# WorldSim, a simulation of the world built in C# with MonoGame
World simulator game built in MonoGame.

This project is only a little fun thing I'm doing in my spare time. The overall idea of the project is to create a simulation of our world filled with random events such as wars, diseases, natural disasters, etc. I'm not setting a specific deadline or timeframe for this project because it is only a small project that I'm doing in my spare time. There will be several inefficiencies when programming this game as I am doing this as an experiment to help me get better at programming with MonoGame and C#. I'll post some screenshots of the game once it's in a presentable state.
